# laravel-apie
Laravel wrapper for the apie library

## What does it do
This is a small wrapper around the library w2w/apie for Laravel. This library maps simple POPO's (Plain Old PHP Objects) to REST api calls. It is very similar to the excellent api platform library.

It also adds a class EloquentModelRetriever to persist and retrieve api resources as Eloquent models and adds a status check to see if it can connect with the database. See the documentation of apie at https://github.com/pieterw2w/apie

## Installation
In your Laravel package you should do the usual steps to install a Laravel package.
```bash
composer require w2w/laravel-apie
```
In case you have no autodiscovery on or your Laravel version is too low, you require to add W2w\Laravel\Apie\Providers\ApiResourceServiceProvider::class to your list of service providers manually.

Publish the api resource config with artisan publish to get a config/api-resource.php file and run migrations to get the database.
```bash
artisan publish
artisan migrate
```

Now visit /api/doc.json to see the generated OpenApi spec. It will only contain specs for the default installed api resources, which is a check to identify your REST API and a health check resource. It will check if it can connect to the database.

## Adding a new api resource
create this class in your app/ApiResources:
```php
<?php
namespace App\RestApi\ApiResources;

use W2w\Lib\Apie\Annotations\ApiResource;
use W2w\Lib\Apie\Persisters\NullPersister;

/**
 * @ApiResource(disabledMethods={"get"}, persistClass=NullPersister::class)
 */
class SumExample
{
    private $one;

    private $two;

    public function __construct(float $one, float $two)
    {
        $this->one = $one;
        $this->two = $two;
    }

    public function getOne(): float
    {
        return $this->one;
    }

    public function getTwo(): float
    {
        return $this->two;
    }

    public function getAddition(): float
    {
        return $this->one + $this->two;
    }

    public function getSubtraction(): float
    {
        return $this->one - $this->two;
    }

    public function getMultiplication(): float
    {
        return $this->one * $this->two;
    }

    public function getDivison(): ?float
    {
        // === and == can fail because of floating points....
        if (abs($this->two) < 0.000001) {
            return null;
        }
        return $this->one / $this->two;
    }
}
```
Now in config/api-resources.php we should add the class to add it to the api resources:
```php
use App\ApiResources\SumExample;
use W2w\Lib\Apie\ApiResources\App;
use W2w\Lib\Apie\ApiResources\Status;

//config/api-resources.php
return [
'resources' => [App:class, Status::class, SumExample::class]
];
```

If you refresh /api/doc.json you can see you get an extra POST call to create a SumExample resource. With any OpenApi tool or with Postman you can test the POST command. If you would make a POST call to /api/sum_example with body
```
{
  "one": 13,
  "two": 1
}
```
You would get:
```
{
  "one": 13,
  "two": 1,
  "addition": 14,
  "subtraction": 12,
  "multiplication": 13,
  "divison": 13
}
```

## Integrate with l5-swagger
There is a laravel package called darkaonline/l5-swagger that is created to display a swagger ui page that shows the REST API in a browser-friendly interface. With a little bit of tweaking it is possible to use this package to show the OpenAPI spec created by this tool.

- Follow the steps at https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger to install the library.
- Publish the config and change the url in the config to a different url to avoid a route conflict.
- Go to the page generated by the library and in the input field at the top replace the path with /api/doc.json and click 'explore'

It is possible to modify the template to always show the documentation.
- Run artisan publish to publish the views of l5-swagger.
- Open file resources/views/vendor/l5-swagger/index.blade.php
- Replace this part of code the url definition:
```javascript
const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
    dom_id: '#swagger-ui',

    url: "{!! route('apie.docs') !!}",
```
    
Now if you refresh you will see your REST API right away.

## Automate registering api resources.
It is possible to automate registering api resources without having to manually update the resources list in config/api-resource.php
- Run
```bash
composer require haydenpierce/class-finder
```
- Open config/api-resource.php
- Edit the file like this:
```php
<?php
//config/api-resource.php
use HaydenPierce\ClassFinder\ClassFinder;
use W2w\Lib\Apie\ApiResources\App;
use W2w\Lib\Apie\ApiResources\Status;

$resources = ClassFinder::getClassesInNamespace('App\RestApi\ApiResources');
$resources[] = App::class;
$resources[] = Status::class;

return [
    'resource' => $resources
];
```
